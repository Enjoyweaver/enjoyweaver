# BeeKeeper Whitepaper

## Abstract

Through a combination of ambition and curiosity, BeeKeeper was created by individuals around the world with a shared vision of supporting those that support the bees. Our intentions are to utilize the capabilities of blockchain and smart contracts to benefit bees globally. As varied and diverse as the problems our bees face are the tools and solutions needed to give them a fair chance at survival.

BeeKeeper aims to be operational for as long as the blockchain itself is present, acting in a manner that mimics the trustless nature of Bitcoin. We will pursue a balance between decentralization and centralization solely for the benefit of BeeKeeper and bee conservation.

## 1. Introduction

BeeKeeper was created with the purpose of combining blockchain capabilities with real-world utility. BeeKeeper's real-world utility will be harnessing blockchain technology for the ability to effect greater change at the ground level for one of our world's challenges. Our plan is to utilize the crowd-funding-like abilities of cryptocurrency to provide financial resources to those who are focused on conserving bees around the world and educating us along the way.

This framework of decision-making will establish a certain level of decentralization for BeeKeeper. Even though pursuing a trustless and decentralized state of operations is part of BeeKeeper's overarching theme, we feel there are inhibitions to pursuing 100% decentralized operations. We will attempt to track our level of decentralization, learn our centralization thresholds, and display our framework of decision making along the way.

## 3. Native vs Non-Native Bees

There are more than 20,000 known wild bee species and an estimated 30,000 honey bee species around the world, though most available data comes from North America and Europe. There are social bees, like bumble bees, that live together and share in baby-rearing and provisioning of foods, and solitary bees, which live and raise their brood alone. For this whitepaper, we will view bees as either native or non-native.

### 3.1 Non-Native Bees

**Western honey bees (Apis mellifera)** are native to Africa, Europe, and Western Asia and are usually referred to as non-native bees in other locations around the world. Nearly 17,000 species of honey bees have been formally described, and as many as 30,000 are estimated worldwide.

The Apis mellifera is often cited as "the honey bee" even though there are at least eight other honey bee species which all produce honey. However, because the eight other "honey bees" live in mild tropical climates, they have no need to store large amounts of nectar. The Apis mellifera has evolved over regions with limited flower production (winter, rainy days, etc), leading to storing large amounts of nectar that dehydrate over time, turning into honey.

**Key Facts:**
- 81 million bee hives worldwide producing 1.6 million tons of honey annually
- Hives can contain upwards of 50,000 bees
- Primarily worker bees (females) under direction of a single queen
- No honey bees existed in America before European settlers brought hives from Europe

**Limitations:**
The honey bee does not know how to pollinate tomato or eggplant flowers and does very poorly compared to native bees when pollinating many native plants, such as pumpkins, cherries, blueberries, and cranberries.

### 3.2 Native Bees

Native bees come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors and are as varied in their life styles as well. In the United States, native bees provide pollination to roughly 80% of flowering plants.

**Solitary Bees:**
Roughly 98% of known bee species are solitary bees where they do not live in large groups. Examples include:
- Mason bee
- Plasterer bee
- Blue orchard bee
- Squash bee
- Teddy bear bee
- Carpenter bee

Approximately 70% of female solitary bees prepare their own nests in the ground, while the remaining nests are usually prepared in cracks in wood.

## 4. Status of Pollinators

### 4.1 Data Availability

Even though there is consensus about the lack of global bee data available, several databases attempt to be a resource:

- Bee Database Project at the American Museum of Natural History
- World Bee Checklist by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System

**Global Data Gaps:**
- United States has over 60% of sampling points (California has more than double any country except Sweden)
- Best sampled countries in Africa, Asia, and South America represent less than 4% of all data points
- 90% of North Asia, 86% of South Asia, 82% of the Middle East, and 79% of Africa and Eurasia are completely unsampled

BeeKeeper will attempt to be useful and meaningful in assisting the collection of data globally to fill these knowledge gaps.

### 4.2 Pollination

Over two-thirds of the earth's food is available because of the pollination of plants, flowers, and vegetables by bees. Pollination is the process of pollen being transferred from the anthers of male plants to the stigmata of female plants so that seeds can be produced from the newly fertilized female plant.

**Pollination Efficiency:**
- Native bee species are often more efficient pollinators than honey bees on a flower-by-flower basis
- Honey bees can pollinate many agricultural crops and forage over long distances (up to 14 km or 8.6 miles from nest)
- Honey bees exhibit sophisticated communication which increases foraging efficiency

### 4.3 Geographic Distribution

The concentration of bees around the world is diverse and so is the vegetation. Europe hosts about 10% of worldwide bee diversity although the continent only represents 7% of global terrestrial habitats. The most prominent family is the Apidae (561 species), which includes the honey bee and bumblebees.

### 4.4 Economic Impact

**Global Value:**
- More than **$500 billion** worth of global food production directly contributed by pollinators
- Agricultural production has increased by **300% in the last 50 years**
- Bee pollination responsible for roughly **9.5%** of total economic value of agriculture production used for food
- In the USA alone, pollination results in **$16 billion annually**

**Regional Impact:**
- Latin America produces 28% of global honey supply with 7.7 million managed honey bee colonies
- Argentina leads the global list in terms of honey market, with more than $200,000 intake related to exports in 2013

## 5. Problem Analysis

### 5.1 Parasites, Viruses & Bacterial Diseases

**Non-Native Bees:**

In the United States, the number of managed colonies dropped from 5.9 million in 1947 to 2.6 million in 1996–2004, falling again to 2.4 million in 2005. The decline from 1985 to 1996 is likely linked to:
- Tracheal mite (Acarapis woodi) - first detected 1984
- Varroa destructor mite - first detected 1987

**Colony Collapse Disorder (2006-2009):**
- One-third of all honey bees were lost
- 50% of colonies lost had identifiable symptoms (like varroa mite)
- Other half exhibited no known causes for loss
- Led to increased research on Israeli Acute Paralysis virus and gut parasite Nosema

**American Foulbrood (AFB):**
Serious infectious disease caused by spore-forming bacteria Paenibacillus larvae. One of the most widespread and destructive diseases affecting honey bee brood. Does not pose health risks to people but wreaks havoc among bees.

**Native Bees:**

Major cause of decline in native bumble bees appears to be recently introduced non-native protozoan parasites:
- Nosema bombi
- Crithidia bombi

Likely from commercial bumble bees imported from Europe for greenhouse pollination.

### 5.2 Ecological Challenges

Several factors affecting bee decline:
- Arthropod pests
- Disease
- Poor nutrition
- Decreases in diversity of food resources
- Loss of habitat
- Lack of genetic diversity
- Pesticides

**Pesticide Impact:**
Pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides have both direct and indirect negative effects on pollinators. In some instances, pesticides are applied to crops when vegetation itself is blooming, increasing bee exposure.

**Habitat Loss:**
- Mountain-top removal for coal
- Dredging rivers for port capacities
- Wetland manipulation for mosquito control
- Urban development
- Agricultural intensification

### 5.3 Agricultural Diversity

The main threat to European bees is habitat loss from:
- Agriculture intensification (pesticides and fertilizers)
- Urban development
- Increased frequency of fires
- Climate change

Each bee species requires their own unique ecosystem to thrive.

### 5.4 Extinction Risk

**United States:**
Of more than 1,400 different native bee species:
- 48% are secure and stable
- 27% are declining
- 24% are declining and threatened with extinction

**Europe:**
- 9% of bees threatened with extinction (as of 2014)
- Insufficient data on 1,101 other bee species

Globally, roughly 16.5% of vertebrate pollinators are threatened with extinction.

## 6. Blockchain Technology

The creation of blockchain has advanced the ability of philanthropy to a new magnitude. The immutability of smart contracts lays the foundation for BeeKeeper to function around the world on a grassroots level, providing direct and immediate impact.

Because of the mobility of blockchain to specific individuals (specifically our cell phones), donations can be given to individuals and organizations indiscriminately in each of our neighborhoods.

### Technology Layers

**First Layer:** The deterministic and trustless manner of the blockchain itself. At this level, the logic of a smart contract is executed as intended without any oversight or governance required.

**BeeKeeper Token:** Our token is programmed on the Binance Smart Chain. Within certain parameters, smart contract functions are decentralized and operate according to the contract logic.

### Risk Framework

Our risk matrix will be treated as a living document that will be updated as the information supplying the matrix changes over time. We will attempt an approach that combines our taxonomy of decentralization with the practicality of donations and resulting impact.

## 7. BeeKeeper Plan of Action

### Global Database

In the United States there are several surveys of beekeepers on the condition of their hives. As valuable as this information is, extending it globally would be more beneficial. We will introduce a course-of-action to gather data on the condition of honey bee hives around the world.

### Ecological Plan

**Regulatory Changes:**
As of January 1, 2017, beekeepers must involve veterinarians for antibiotic treatments to control American foulbrood. This regulatory change is part of FDA's strategy to promote judicious use of antibiotics and reduce antibiotic resistance.

**Success Stories:**
In Canada, citizens of Guelph, Ontario created the world's first Pollinator Park at the Eastview landfill site - turning about 100 acres into an oasis for bees and other pollinators with proper plantings and habitat for nesting.

### Farming Support

Farmers worldwide hire beekeepers to assist in crop pollination. For example, almond farmers in the United States pay up to $300 per acre for beekeepers to pollinate their crops every February. This cost ultimately reaches consumers, totaling roughly $5-14 billion.

BeeKeeper has a unique opportunity to assist farmers not only with pollination but with maintaining bees that pollinate their crops. Our intention is to provide solutions for bees first and offer solutions for farmers secondarily.

## 8. Tokenomics

BeeKeeper's purpose exists through ground-level, grassroots tokenomics. For BeeKeeper to be effective, our donations must align with the solutions discussed above. We will be specific with donations in ways that effect change according to our Risk Matrix.

### Education Scholarship

We are establishing scholarships for students pursuing degrees toward the study of bees (pollinators) around the world. Scholarships will be:
- For the duration of the student's education (not one-time)
- Given at incremental trading volume levels
- Accompanied by wholistic support for recipients

### Civic Donation

BeeKeeper provides donations to individuals providing solutions to bees in their own neighborhoods. You don't need to be a business, charity, or current beekeeper to receive a civic donation.

**Purpose:**
Provide immediate impact in neighborhoods worldwide. Locations chosen based on:
- Challenges bees are facing
- Possible solutions available

**Example:**
In the United States, the Eucera fulvohirta bee is declining and threatened with extinction. Native to Georgia, Louisiana, and North Carolina, civic donations in these states can provide:
- Details of threats to bees in that area
- Suitable vegetation for increasing bee numbers
- Housing solutions to provide

### Personal Action Impact Motivator

Direct donations to individuals practicing bee conservation:
- Planting bee-friendly gardens
- Creating homes for bees (especially solitary bees)
- Raising awareness and education
- Reducing pesticide use

### Token Allocation & Transaction Tax

[To be determined based on final tokenomics structure]
