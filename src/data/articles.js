    content: `AI is not the solution, it is the tool to help YOU get to the solution faster.

AI is going to expediate the human revolution, not create its own.

Way back in time, as we understood metal better, our swords got stronger and our hammers stopped breaking. AI is no different, its a tool and if you have someone on your team who understands how to build and strategize using AI, then your company will advance and can strategically outpace those who dont.

In 1965, Moore's Law stated that computer chip capacity would double approximately every two years, leading to exponential growth in computing power. According to a 2023 study from Stanford University's Human-Centered AI Institute, AI models' capabilities are doubling in performance metrics every 6-9 months on key reasoning and language tasks, far outpacing the historical growth rate of traditional computing power.

The companies treating AI as their solution rather than their tool are already falling behind‚Äîand they don't even know it.

Copying your content and pasting it into AI and copying the results and pasting it in to your email/newsletter/Teams or Slack message is not how you utilize AI. If you are doing that then you are treating AI as the solution and not as a tool. AI needs to help you get to the solution faster, not create the solution.

One of the benefits of AI is that it can be used in an unbiased manner if you understand that AI is not meant to be your source of reason and decision-making. I've seen too many managers and Chiefs copy the results directly from AI and paste it believing that was a solution, when in fact its not the solution at all - its intellectual fraud because you just defrauded yourself and your company. And not to mention you just got lazier, decreased your expectations, and certainly didnt proof-read because you left the "and what else can I do for you?" at the bottom of the email/newsletter/Teams or Slack message.

While everyone debates AI replacing humans, the quiet revolution is happening in forward-thinking companies who are not too afraid to strategize, to innovate, and to utilize their employees talent to build, scale, and create value.

AI needs to be used as a tool to index, to combine, to resource, to be a 24/7 unbiased-employee that can be multiplied in an instant and used concurrently to manage many many many tasks at once, but never as the source of your solution.

If you've got someone on your team who can build AI-driven processes to help your company increase efficiency then good for you. But, if you've got someone on your team who can build full-stack autonomous processes equivalent to an organization and that can scale with every customer, then lucky you because they can take your company to the next realm.`,

    content: `Did you know that performing tasks at the wrong time of day can reduce your performance by up to 26%? Research shows that when tasks are not aligned with your chronotype (whether you're a morning lark or night owl), your basic cognitive abilities - from working memory to analytical processing - suffer significantly.

No matter how hard I worked in a day or how much I got done, I often felt like I could have accomplished more. Some days, despite making what seemed like progress, I barely felt like I'd taken a step forward. This frustration led me down a path of researching scheduling methods and productivity optimization.

What I discovered was fascinating: our cognitive abilities fluctuate dramatically throughout the day, and these patterns are largely predictable based on our chronotype. Morning people excel at analytical tasks early in the day, while night owls might perform complex creative work better in the evening.

The science was compelling, but more importantly, it was actionable. So, I started building https://MyCalendy.fun as a personal side project. What began as a tool to help me take back control of my schedule has grown into something I'm excited to share with you.

I realized I wasn't capturing my full mental potential by simply scheduling tasks in the next available slot, when it felt convenient, or when others chose my appointments for me. My Calendy works with you to understand your cognitive fluctuations and your schedule, then aligns your tasks accordingly.

Need analytical thinking? My Calendy schedules that for when your brain is sharpest. Creative writing? It plans that for when your imagination peaks. It's like having a personal productivity coach guiding you toward optimal performance hour by hour.

The results can be transformative. By matching your cognitive strengths to appropriate tasks throughout the day, you can reclaim hours of productive time each week. Whether you're a morning lark or a night owl, My Calendy ensures you're working at your cognitive best.

I built this tool because I wanted to work smarter, not harder. Now I'm inviting you to experience the difference that cognitive-based scheduling can make in your productivity and wellbeing.

      "Why does Web3 need principle-based regulation? Each layer of the blockchain stack presents unique challenges that require tailored solutions.",
    content: `A Principled Approach to Web3 Regulation

Why does Web3 need principle-based regulation?

The quick answer is that each layer of the blockchain stack presents unique challenges that require tailored solutions. Rather than forcing a single rigid framework to fit every situation, principle-based regulation focuses on risk, security, blockchain innovation, and privacy while leaving room for Web3's rapid and continuous evolution. This is important because, as seen with wallets and auditor liability, a one-size-fits-all or reactionary approaches can stifle innovation and still fail to protect consumers in very specific, and often predictable, scenarios.

Why Layers Matter

Historically, laws tend to be reactionary‚Äîcreated only after an incident occurs. In the context of Web3, though, reactionary laws risk falling behind the speed of innovation. The Blockchain Regulation Matrix (BRM) introduced in our previous posts breaks the blockchain down into distinct layers, from Electricity and Settlement to Application and Permanent Storage, plus the critical roles played by Developers, Programming Language Auditors, and DeFi Architecture Security. Each layer has its own set of risks (like node centralization or onchain data vulnerabilities), security considerations (like preventing double-spends in the consensus layer), blockchain innovation (like inventing a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of another blockchain), and privacy implications (like browser-based tracking in the internet layer).

A Layer-by-Layer Breakdown

Electricity
- Risk: Governments and industries worry about excessive energy consumption or environmental impact if validators rely on fossil fuels.
- Security: Consistent power supply is crucial for uptime, as outages could disrupt the network or concentrate mining power in certain regions.
- Blockchain Innovation: Encouraging renewables or other alternative energy solutions can stimulate new infrastructure models tailored for blockchain.
- Privacy: Direct privacy concerns here are minimal, but data centers might be subject to local laws that could reveal operational details.

Settlement Layer
- Risk: If finality is unclear, disputes can arise over transaction validity, hurting consumer trust.
- Security: Any weaknesses in the layer securing transaction records could allow double-spends or chain reorganizations.
- Blockchain Innovation: Exploring advanced settlement algorithms, sidechains, or DAG-based models can improve throughput without compromising decentralization.
- Privacy: While settlement data is often public, adding configurable privacy features (like zero-knowledge proofs) can protect sensitive transactions.

Node / Validator
- Risk: A small group of malicious or negligent validators could compromise the network's reliability.
- Security: Proper infrastructure and consensus participation help maintain a robust, fault-tolerant network.
- Blockchain Innovation: Experimentation with validator incentives or new governance mechanisms can bolster decentralization.
- Privacy: Identifying node operators can raise surveillance concerns; privacy protections may limit forced disclosures.

Consensus Layer
- Risk: Vulnerabilities in consensus algorithms (like Sybil attacks or 51% attacks) can undermine the entire chain.
- Security: Protocols like PoW and PoS require different security assumptions; each demands careful evaluation of attack vectors.
- Blockchain Innovation: Exploring novel consensus methods‚Äîlike DAGs or hybrid models‚Äîpromotes efficient scalability and eco-friendly solutions.
- Privacy: Public consensus often means transparent transaction validation, though some systems include partial confidentiality via zero-knowledge proofs.

Transaction Layer
- Risk: Fraud, phishing, or front-running can target users if transaction data is exposed.
- Security: Mechanisms like mempool encryption or time-delay transactions reduce vulnerabilities.
- Blockchain Innovation: New transaction models (e.g., layer-2 rollups) reduce fees and congestion, allowing faster, cheaper transfers.
- Privacy: User addresses and amounts may be visible; solutions like mixers or confidential transactions can mitigate privacy leaks.

On-chain Data Storage
- Risk: Permanently storing illicit or personal data creates legal and ethical dilemmas.
- Security: Storing sensitive info on-chain raises the stakes for hacks or unauthorized reads.
- Blockchain Innovation: Evolving storage solutions (e.g., IPFS pinning, layer-2 data shards) can boost efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
- Privacy: Immutability clashes with privacy laws (like GDPR's "right to be forgotten"), prompting careful, layered storage approaches.

How Do We Apply Principles to These Layers?

Principle-based regulation focuses on risk mitigation, security by design, supporting blockchain innovation, and privacy & consumer protection. Below is an expanded look at how each principle comes into play:

Risk Mitigation
Each layer has unique vulnerabilities‚Äîsuch as potential double-spend attacks in the consensus layer, stablecoin collateralization issues at the asset layer, or phishing exploits in the application layer. By identifying these risks and setting minimum standards, regulators can encourage responsible innovation while protecting consumers.

Security by Design
Open-source development, logic-trees, regular security audits, and rigorous testing are crucial to safeguarding the blockchain ecosystem. As noted in our Auditor Liability article, establishing clear guidelines for code audits helps prevent hidden exploits. This principle also covers developer education, ensuring that teams follow secure coding practices from the start rather than patching vulnerabilities after launch.

Supporting Blockchain Innovation
A flexible regulatory approach lets projects explore new ideas‚Äîlike novel consensus mechanisms (e.g., DAGs), advanced privacy solutions, or cross-chain interoperability‚Äîwithout facing immediate roadblocks. Regulators focused on fostering blockchain innovation aim to avoid blanket prohibitions, favoring pilot programs or conditional approvals that allow emerging technologies to prove themselves under real-world conditions.

Privacy & Consumer Protection
Balancing the public nature of most blockchains with user confidentiality is tricky. Principle-based rules keep privacy in check without demanding universal anonymity or unlimited disclosure. For instance, zero-knowledge proofs could let users verify transactions while concealing details. At the same time, consumer protection mandates transparency around fees, risks, and terms of service to prevent hidden scams or exploitative practices.

Feasibility for Bureaucracy
New laws must be practical for agencies and their employees to understand, implement, and enforce. If legislation demands too much extra training or special tools, it can slow everything down and lead to uneven enforcement. By keeping the language clear and focusing on core principles, regulators can craft rules that fit into existing processes. This way, oversight bodies can handle Web3 matters without having to invest in major new systems, and businesses can more easily follow the rules without sacrificing innovation.

Avoiding Over-Regulation vs. Under-Regulation
- Over-Regulation can force innovators out of the market or create black markets for riskier blockchain use-cases.
- Under-Regulation could expose consumers to unchecked scams, security exploits, and privacy invasions like we are dealing with now.
By adopting a principle-based approach, regulators and industry players can keep regulations flexible yet effective, focusing on what needs to be protected and why, rather than prescribing overly detailed how-to steps that may become outdated as quickly as new code is written.

Government Concerns and Collaboration
Governments are understandably concerned about consumer protection, fraud, tax compliance, and national security issues. But as we learned in the intro to Crypto Policy Center, purely applying traditional frameworks to Web3 can lead to dead ends or stifle innovation. A collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach‚Äîwhere industry, policymakers, and consumer advocates actively participate‚Äîtends to produce better outcomes. This echoes the logic behind why we created the Blockchain Regulation Matrix (BRM): to foster structured dialogue that considers each unique layer and the overarching principles.

Conclusion
A principled approach to Web3 regulation acknowledges the interplay of risk, security, blockchain innovation, and privacy at each layer of the blockchain. Rather than imposing a single blanket framework, it allows regulators and innovators to craft specific guidelines for each layer, ensuring that consumer protection and innovation remain at the forefront.

By examining these layers individually‚Äîjust as we do in our Wallets and Regulation and Auditor Liability articles‚Äîgovernments and the Web3 community can navigate the complexities of blockchain technology more effectively. We look forward to continuing to build on this layered approach as we refine legislative drafts, share new frameworks, and collaborate with the broader crypto community to shape what responsible regulation can look like.`,

      "Stablecoins are the anchor for the crypto market‚Äîbut what happens when that anchor isn't secured?",
    content: `Why Stablecoins Need Regulation

Stablecoins are the anchor for the crypto market‚Äîbut what happens when that anchor isn't secured?

Stablecoins are one of the most significant innovations in the Web3 ecosystem because they create a stable store of value in a crypto market prone to price fluctuations. They are typically pegged to a specific asset‚Äîmost commonly the U.S. dollar‚Äîmaking them less volatile than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This reduced volatility makes them ideal for everyday transactions and as a "safe haven" to which investors retreat during times of market turbulence. However, as we've learned from our Principled Approach to Web3 Regulation, this added layer of reliability introduces new risks that demand thoughtful, principle-based regulation.

What are stablecoins?
Not all crypto tokens are built the same and that is especially true for "stable" coins which come in several different designs. They can be:

- Fiat-backed: meaning the stablecoins are minted when a user trades for them.
- Algorithmic: meaning that the pricing mechanism is determined by an algorithm based on the many liquidity pools that make up the stablecoin.
- Crypto-backed: meaning that other crypto tokens represent the liquidity and pricing functionality of that stablecoin.
- Commodity-backed: meaning that a commodity like gold or silver represents the value and pricing functionality of that stablecoin.

How does a stablecoin get "backed" by other liquidity and how does it stay stable?
Each token that is created is just a token until its creator wants it to be purchased by the public, thats when the mechanism to determine and enforce the tokens price needs to be established and constructed. Traditionally, when a non-stable token is to be purchased by the public, the pricing mechanism and equation used is the Constant Product Formula, or the x * y = k equation. In this formula, x represents the quantity of the token you want to sell and y represents the token used to buy it, while k remains constant across all trades within the liquidity pool. Because this formula is enforced by the smart contract, it is immutable and self-executing‚Äîmeaning no centralized authority can alter it. Each trade automatically updates the token balances, causing the price to shift and update in real-time, and every transaction is recorded on the blockchain for anyone to inspect. This transparent, onchain mechanism holds the token price accountable to actual market activity rather than human intervention or external manipulation.

Stablecoins, however, rely heavily on offchain components like external oracles, real-world collateral, or algorithmic controls to maintain their peg. While these can be effective in theory, they are more complex and not as easily audited on a continuous basis, making it challenging to verify the promised stability or backing. By contrast, the Constant Product Formula operates entirely onchain, making it straightforward for market participants to verify that trades are executed according to immutable smart contract rules. This contrast highlights why non-stable coins benefit from immediate, trustless price discovery, while stablecoins often require more layers of oversight and regulation to ensure they remain truly "stable."

There are many stablecoins out there but for the sake of this article we are focusing on USDT, DAI, USDC, and UST, and especially during this time period:

- USDC (11/02/2018 ‚Äì 5/28/2022)
- USDT (11/9/2017 ‚Äì 5/28/2022)
- DAI (11/19/2019 ‚Äì 5/28/2022)
- UST (Terra) (11/26/2020 ‚Äì 5/28/2022)

The stable-ness of the USDT, DAI, USDC, and UST (Terra) tokens were assessed through a multiple regression model with market cap and transaction volume taken at daily increments. The desire here is to understand the ballast, or weight, that an individual stablecoins market cap has on the impact that the transaction volume has on the price swing for that day, if there is any. As cryptocurrency is becoming more adopted, we want to know if they are scalable to maintain their peg with the increasing transaction volume and market cap.

This report analyzes the weight, or significance, that the market cap has on the influence between the price swing, or the high and low prices, for any particular day, so that we can attempt to create a forecasting model to predict future price swings based on an individual tokens market cap. The assumption to start this all was that as a tokens market cap increases, the less of an affect the daily transaction volume has on the swing in a stablecoins price, which would be the ballast of that token.

Below are the scale ranges for USDT, USDC, and DAI:

| Metric | USDT | USDC | DAI |
|--------|------|------|-----|
| Max Ballast or Worst Factor | 56,338 | 16.12 | 42.21 |
| Min Ballast or Best Factor | 0.00008 | 0.00052 | 0.00178 |
| Highest Price Swing at $500‚Äì600 million mcap | 0.138309 | 0.131202 | 0.0270 |

Immediately interpreting the results, we see that USDC has a shallow ballast with its worst factor being 16.12, though the ballast factor does not get as low, or as close to 0 as we would like for it to be. DAI has a ballast range furthest from 0 while its worst ballast factor is more than twice that of USDC. USDT has widest ballast range with the worst factor being 56,338, however, its ballast range does come the closest to 0.

Why Do We Need Stablecoin Regulation?

When reading about the Wallets and Regulation post, we see how individual users are responsible for their own digital assets‚Äîthere's no centralized bank bailing you out. With stablecoins, the underlying collateral (whether fiat, crypto, or algorithmic mechanisms) must be transparent and trustworthy. Otherwise, if the backing assets are misrepresented‚Äîor if there is no real backing at all‚Äîconsumers could lose faith and pull their funds en masse, effectively causing a run on the stablecoin. Such systemic risk can affect the broader crypto market and even bleed into traditional financial markets.

Similarly, the Intro to Crypto Policy DAO article highlights the importance of designing legislation that anticipates technological innovations rather than just reacting to them. Stablecoins enable frictionless, near-instant cross-border transactions. They also serve as a gateway to DeFi opportunities that often yield returns well above traditional bank rates. But without clarity around their legal status, capital requirements, consumer disclosures, or redemption policies, stablecoins could easily slip through the cracks of existing financial frameworks. This lack of clarity endangers both consumers and innovators alike.

Key Reasons for Regulation:

1. Consumer Protection
Stablecoin projects must adhere to transparent backing practices, offer redemption assurances, and disclose how and where their reserves are held. This mirrors how the banking system provides deposit insurance, but now in a new crypto context.

2. Market Stability
If a major stablecoin project fails or is suspected of insolvency, it can send shockwaves across the market‚Äîmuch like how a failing bank can prompt a broader financial crisis. Thoughtful rules around collateralization and reporting help shore up confidence.

3. Risk Mitigation at the Asset Layer
As noted in our Principled Approach to Web3 Regulation, the Asset Layer is where tokens like stablecoins live. The same principle-based framework that addresses security, innovation, and privacy should be extended to stablecoins, requiring projects to regularly verify their reserves, undergo independent audits, and disclose critical risk factors.

4. Enabling Innovation
Proper regulation can foster, rather than stifle, innovation. If stablecoin issuers can operate within a clear legal framework, they are more likely to partner with traditional financial institutions, expand payment systems, and drive user adoption. Overly harsh or ill-fitting rules, on the other hand, risk pushing development underground or offshore.

Stablecoins are the "bridge" between traditional finance and DeFi‚Äîmaking clear, principle-based regulation essential.

Principle-Based Regulation in Action

As we discussed in the Principled Approach to Web3 Regulation, regulation must be tailored to each layer of the blockchain. For stablecoins:

Risk Mitigation
Clear guidelines for collateralization, auditing, and solvency reduce the chance of a "run" or sudden collapse.

Security by Design
Open-source contracts, frequent third-party audits, and robust redemption policies help ensure that stablecoin smart contracts and reserve mechanisms work as intended.

Supporting Blockchain Innovation
Encouraging pilot programs for new stablecoin models (e.g., algorithmic, hybrid) allows the market to experiment while maintaining essential guardrails, much like the draft legislation for wallets that balances consumer safety with innovation.

Privacy & Consumer Protection
While stablecoins can be more transparent than traditional bank accounts, they also raise questions about potential overreach if user data is tracked. Regulators must find the middle ground between preventing illicit activities and preserving user privacy.

Conclusion

Stablecoins are a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, acting as a buffer against volatile price swings while enabling seamless trading and payments. Yet their very stability depends on trust‚Äîwhich in turn necessitates effective, principle-based regulation. Drawing on lessons from our Wallets and Regulation and Principled Approach to Web3 Regulation articles, policymakers and industry leaders must collaborate to craft rules that protect consumers, ensure liquidity and solvency, and foster the next generation of decentralized finance solutions.

By applying the same layer-by-layer thinking we have used throughout our other posts and focusing on risk mitigation, security by design, supporting blockchain innovation, and privacy & consumer protection, we can develop a stable regulatory framework for stablecoins‚Äîensuring they remain a secure, trusted, and innovative part of the broader Web3 ecosystem.`,

    content: `Wallets and Regulation

Why does my wallet require regulation?

There is no bank in crypto. You control your keys and your assets, which means you are your own bank. However, you didn't build that bank, nor did you design the cryptography that creates your private keys. This introduces risks that may not have been addressed if you had built the bank yourself.

In the United States, the government insures your assets in a bank up to $250,000 in case the bank fails and your money disappears. This means that if you have more than $250,000 in one bank, you lose the difference above the insured amount.

The government can insure your assets because there are laws governing this process, along with a financial backstop at the business level in case a bank fails and customers lose their money due to risks beyond their control. Additionally, there is a chance of systemic risks affecting multiple banks, which may or may not be within the banks' control. These laws provide greater financial security.

Most banks don't hold all the funds their customers deposit, but the blockchain does. You access your blockchain assets through a wallet, but the wallet doesn't hold your assets‚Äîit is merely an access point. When you create a wallet, you generate a private key and a seed phrase. If you use one wallet brand, you can input your private key or seed phrase into another wallet brand to access the same assets. This level of interoperability doesn't exist in the physical world, making blockchain wallets a unique domain for regulation.

Cryptography may not need regulation, but it must be understood so that applicable laws can be implemented and updated as needed. Zero-day vulnerabilities exist, and while laws don't need to change in a single day, they must adapt to new education and mitigation techniques derived from these vulnerabilities.

What makes up the function of a wallet and what functions are able to even regulated and why?

Wallets are created differently and serve various purposes, requiring careful consideration of their regulation. There are several types of wallets, including:

- Single-Signature Wallets: Require only one signature to authorize transactions.
- Multi-Signature Wallets: Require multiple parties to sign a transaction though each wallet is an independently controlled and operated wallet.
- Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Wallets: Use collaborative cryptographic techniques for transaction approval, distinct from multi-signature wallets like those from Gnosis Safe.

Wallets can also be categorized as:

- Hot Wallets: Internet-connected wallets, such as browser-based, bowser extensions, or app-based wallets.
- Cold Wallets: Not connected to the internet. Some, like Ledger, can connect through an app, while others, like hardware security modules (HSMs), are never internet-connected, offering unique security profiles. When you create a wallet, the blockchain generates a private key, and your wallet derives a seed phrase from it. These keys and phrases are presented and stored differently‚Äîsometimes permanently, sometimes temporarily. These processes require regulatory oversight to protect consumers and their assets.

How Private Keys and Seed Phrases Influence Regulatory Focus

When creating a wallet, the blockchain generates a private key, and the wallet then interprets and displays a corresponding seed phrase. Both the private key and seed phrase are critical to asset security. Their generation, storage, and presentation to the user require careful regulatory attention, including guidelines for:

Secure Key Generation Methods: Ensuring that the cryptographic libraries and random number generators used are audited, certified, and free from known vulnerabilities.
Seed Phrase Display Practices: Requiring that the seed phrase never be transmitted unencrypted over the internet, that users are warned to back it up securely offline, and that wallet providers disclose how seed phrases are handled internally.
Temporary vs. Permanent Storage: Establishing rules around where and how the private key and seed phrase can be cached, stored, or backed up‚Äîespecially if they are ever retained on the provider's infrastructure.

A principle-based approach to wallet regulation

Key Principles Might Include:

1. Security by Design: Regulators would require that wallets be developed following industry best practices for encryption, key generation, and access controls. Similar to existing cybersecurity standards (e.g., ISO 27001), wallet developers would need to prove they follow secure development lifecycles and conduct routine external audits.

2. Adaptability and Continual Improvement: Regulators and industry participants collaborate to update guidelines as new threats emerge. This iterative approach is inspired by the way safety standards evolve in industries like aviation or automotive manufacturing. As zero-day vulnerabilities arise, the regulation encourages rapid patching, transparent communication, and proactive standards updates.

3. Developer and Provider Accreditation: Legislation could require wallet developers and organizations to obtain and accreditation or license issued by a regulatory body. Achieving this would entail meeting minimum standards in cryptography implementation, code auditing, user experience safeguards, and secure key handling.

4. Specialized Training: Developers may need to complete specific courses in applied cryptography, secure coding practices, threat modeling, and regulatory compliance. These could be offered by accredited institutions and updated regularly to reflect emerging threats and best practices.

5. Structured Consumer Education Reguirements: Legislation could require that every accredited wallet provider deliver standarized user education as part of the onboarding process. This could include interactive modules covering seed phrase management, safe key storage, phishing awareness, and instructions for verifying wallet authenticity. Additionally, support channels should be available to help users respond to breaches or key-compromise events.

6. Transparent Documents and Guides: A central repository of best practices, updated regulatory guidelines, and consumer-focused security resources can be maintained by a governing body. Wallet providers would be required to link to this repository, ensuring even novice users have easy access to trusted educational materials.

7. Regulatory Oversight Agencies: Just as financial regulators oversee banking standards, specialized agencies or departments within existing financial oversight bodies could be established to monitor wallet providers' compliance, audit code submissions, and enforce penalties for non-compliance.`,

What is Auditor Liability and why is it important?

Understanding the nuances between developer intent and code execution is critical in establishing clear Audit Liability standards in web3.

The expectation of a smart contract audit often exceeds reality, as developers may not fully grasp the concept of defining a user journey or the extent of potential vulnerabilities, which is crucial in establishing clear boundaries for Auditor Liability. Though, when dealing with programming languages, fully comprehending all potential actions of a smart contract can be challenging. Developers aim to ensure their contracts operate as intended and are free from vulnerabilities that could result in loss of funds or unintended outcomes. However, smart contracts operate based on the defined logic principles and syntax of the programming language used, meaning certain operations are strictly bound by these rules. The importance of clearly defining Auditor Liability cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts the trust and security of smart contracts in the web3 ecosystem.

Auditors must go beyond merely identifying potential errors, they need to grasp the developer's intended user-journey and expectations of the dApp (decentralized app - because its an app deployed on decentralized blockchain tech as opposed to centralized tech like Google Cloud or AWS) to ensure the smart contracts behave as expected. For example, in the programming language Solidity, a common issue is integer overflow and underflow, and an integer overflow might be a deliberate feature in some scenarios, like resetting a counter, rather than a vulnerability. Misinterpreting these intentions can lead to misguided corrections and unintended actions. A deep understanding of the developer's goals and the application's context is essential for auditors to accurately assess and report on the contract's safety and functionality.

Auditor Liability begins with the auditing scope and ends with the implementation of the corrections, so establishing the parameters that define it is necessary in order to understand if an audit is thorough, comprehensive, and utilizing up to-date smart contract best practices. Establishing a standard framework for Auditor Liability requires clear communication of what occurs during an audit, including educating developers on the importance of defining user journeys and security expectations they may not have considered.

What is Integer Overflow?

Integer overflow occurs when a calculation exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a variable. In Solidity, for example, the uint8 data type can store values from 0 to 255, so if you add 1 to 255, it overflows and wraps around to 0, which could be intentional or it could be unintentional and lead to a possible exploit.

uint8 max = 255;
uint8 result = max + 1;

However, in actuality, this is what is occurring:
result = 255 + 1 = 0

What is Integer underflow?

Integer underflow occurs when a calculation goes below the minimum value that can be stored in a variable. Using the same uint8 data type in Solidity, if you subtract 1 from 0, it underflows and wraps around to 255.

uint8 min = 0;
uint8 result = min - 1;

As well, in this scenario, since uint8 cannot store negative numbers, subtracting 1 from 0 causes it to wrap around to the highest value, which is 255.
result = 0 - 1 = 255

One of the benefits of programming languages in smart contracts is that you can reuse other code that is audited and continually tested in real-time, and an example of this is OpenZeppelin which created the SafeMath library. The SafeMath library is available for anyone to use in their contract which makes that particular section of the code more readable and more understood regarding the developers intended actions.

Example with the SafeMath OpenZeppelin import:

using SafeMath for uint8;
uint8 max = 255;
uint8 result = max.add(1); // This will revert the transaction
uint8 min = 0;
uint8 result = min.sub(1); // This will revert the transaction

Even though OpenZeppelin's SafeMath exist for Solidity, it is not present in all pogramming languages for various reasons, though some are because it is not needed. For example, in Vyper, Tezos, and Move integer overflow and underflow are inherently prevented as the language includes built-in checks that revert transactions on such operations. This design choice simplifies development and enhances security, but it still necessitates a comprehensive audit to ensure there are no other logical errors or overlooked vulnerabilities.

Comparison of programming languages:

| Language | Integer Overflow/Underflow Vulnerability | Mitigation Method |
|----------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Solidity | Yes (pre-0.8.0) / No (0.8.0+) | Library (SafeMath) / Syntax (0.8.0+) |
| Vyper | No | Syntax |
| Rust | Yes | Syntax (Debug mode)/Library (Release mode) |
| C++ | Yes | Manual / Library / Compiler options |
| Tezos (Michelson) | No | Syntax |
| Move (Libra) | No | Syntax |
| Cairo | No | Syntax |
| Bitcoin Script | No | Syntax |

So how do we define Auditor Liability?

While tools like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath exist, Auditor Liability includes assessing whether developers have appropriately implemented such best practices, and educating them on the historical context and importance of these standards.

Auditor Liability encompasses not only identifying vulnerabilities but also bridging the gap between a developer's often incomplete vision and the actual code implementation, necessitating a deep understanding of both intended functionality and potential exploit history. This is crucial in smart contract auditing as both parties should rely on the audit with almost equal weight. Furthermore, continuous education and updates on evolving best practices and emerging vulnerabilities are vital for both developers and auditors to maintain a high standard of security in smart contract deployments.

Auditor Liability is not just about identifying flaws; it's about understanding and documenting the logic behind every decision made in the code. As such, we are suggesting the use of a Logic Tree as a roadmap, laying out each step in the contract's execution and highlighting areas where risks might emerge. By incorporating this approach, both developers and auditors can ensure a more transparent and secure deployment process.

Logic Tree

To illustrate how a logical tree could define the intended outcome of smart contracts, we will use the standard ERC20 token as an example below:

ERC20 Token Contract Initialization in Solidity

‚îÇ     ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Risk Mitigation - Negate through manual code prevention: Not applicable
‚îÇ     ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Vulnerability: Single point of failure for token issuance

‚îÇ     ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Risk Mitigation - Negate through manual code prevention: Implement multi-sig wallet

This example further illustrates how a developer could benefit from using a logic tree when writing their smart contracts and especially when they provide an auditor with their code.

How do we hold the auditor accountable and define liability?

At this point, a logic tree only holds the developer accountable, though the intention is for a logic tree to establish accountability for both the developer and the auditor. And this is especially important because with all profession's whose business is their professional opinion, liability must be clearly defined so that it can be clearly enforced.

In other professions there are boards, committees, and governing bodies to establish and define professional liability and the same must be done with web3 auditors. The logic tree above is a basis to defining and implementing auditor liability and should be used accordingly. By creating a web3 agency the government can address the growing need to hold auditors accountable for their professional opinions and to establish more trust in web3 that is greatly needed.`,

Lobbying for Web3-friendly Regulation

The Blockchain Regulation Matrix (BRM) establishes a framework of the concerns of regulating the blockchain from both the government and the consumer perspective, and in doing so, provides a pragmatic and clear approach to Web3 regulation. The BRM outlines the blockchain stack in layers starting with the electricity that is physically supporting the blockchain at the base layer, all the way to the process of offloading crypto to fiat currency. The primary objective of the BRM is to understand where and how regulation of the blockchain should be developed specific to each layer, so on the left side of the matrix are centralized projects and on the right side are decentralized ones.

The first row of the BRM is the electricity that powers the entire blockchain, and that includes both centralized and decentralized projects doing so. For example, if the electricity is produced by a private company or a municipality, then that would be a centralized project. For a decentralized electricity producing project, lets consider a group of individuals that build a solar farm together and use the electricity to power their bitcoin mining rigs. By viewing each layer in terms of centralization and decentralization, we can apply a framework that allows us to pinpoint the considerations needed in order to compose web3-friendly regulation. From the governments perspective, web3-friendly regulation is to clearly and distinctly outline what is taxable and what is criminal. From the consumers perspective, it means regulation that protects consumers from criminals and their governments while not inhibiting technological advancements, social advancements, and global consumerism.

Row by row application

Now for each row above, we apply the below in order to understand the concerns from a broad perspective.

a) Government Concerns
  - example a
  - example b
  - example c

b) Consumer Risks
  - example a
  - example b
  - example c

c) Cons to over-regulation
  - example a
  - example b
  - example c

d) Cons to lack of regulation
  - example a
  - example b
  - example c

e) Does technology / terminology exist that meets all of the consumer and government risks?
    If so, what is it and what considerations above is it fulfilling?

An example of this is the Electricity layer, or the electricity being supplied to the blockchain. For the most part we know that the role of the government is to protect its citizens and then to tax them, so its safe to assume that the most of the governments concern's are going to be along those lines for every one of the layers in the BRM.

On the centralized side of the Electricity layer is:

Centralized Electricity Layer
- Government Concerns
  - Protecting consumers from loss of use due to a geopolitical situation
  - Amount of electricity required to maintain the blockchain and the amount per transaction
- Consumer Risks
  - Potential geopolitical risks leading to electricity access disruptions
- Cons to over-regulation
  - Potential risks of concentration and control by certain countries
- Cons to lack of regulation
  - Potential displacement of development activities to more permissive jurisdictions
- Does blockchain technology / terminology currently exist to fulfill these obligations, and if so, what is it?

Decentralized Electricity Layer
- Government Concerns
  - Protecting consumers from loss of use due to a geopolitical situation
  - Amount of electricity required to maintain the blockchain and the amount per transaction
- Consumer Risks
  - Potential geopolitical risks leading to electricity access disruptions
- Cons to over-regulation
  - Potential risks of concentration and control by certain countries
- Cons to lack of regulation
  - Potential displacement of development activities to more permissive jurisdictions
- Does blockchain technology / terminology currently exist to fulfill these obligations, and if so, what is it?

The goal is to create to clear, concise, principle-based legislation that fulfils each of the considerations above. So, once we have a firm understanding of what those concerns are, then the next step is to learn about anything that currently exists that fulfil those considerations and can be used as a template for principle-based legislation. The hope is that something currently fulfills those considerations and become a basis for understanding how to create pragmatic and principle-based legislation.`,
