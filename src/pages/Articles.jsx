AI is going to expediate the human revolution, not create its own.

Way back in time, as we understood metal better, our swords got stronger and our hammers stopped breaking. AI is no different, its a tool and if you have someone on your team who understands how to build and strategize using AI, then your company will advance and can strategically outpace those who dont.

In 1965, Moore's Law stated that computer chip capacity would double approximately every two years, leading to exponential growth in computing power. According to a 2023 study from Stanford University's Human-Centered AI Institute, AI models' capabilities are doubling in performance metrics every 6-9 months on key reasoning and language tasks, far outpacing the historical growth rate of traditional computing power.

The companies treating AI as their solution rather than their tool are already falling behind‚Äîand they don't even know it.

Copying your content and pasting it into AI and copying the results and pasting it in to your email/newsletter/Teams or Slack message is not how you utilize AI. If you are doing that then you are treating AI as the solution and not as a tool. AI needs to help you get to the solution faster, not create the solution.

One of the benefits of AI is that it can be used in an unbiased manner if you understand that AI is not meant to be your source of reason and decision-making. I've seen too many managers and Chiefs copy the results directly from AI and paste it believing that was a solution, when in fact its not the solution at all - its intellectual fraud because you just defrauded yourself and your company. And not to mention you just got lazier, decreased your expectations, and certainly didnt proof-read because you left the "and what else can I do for you?" at the bottom of the email/newsletter/Teams or Slack message.

While everyone debates AI replacing humans, the quiet revolution is happening in forward-thinking companies who are not too afraid to strategize, to innovate, and to utilize their employees talent to build, scale, and create value.

AI needs to be used as a tool to index, to combine, to resource, to be a 24/7 unbiased-employee that can be multiplied in an instant and used concurrently to manage many many many tasks at once, but never as the source of your solution.

If you've got someone on your team who can build AI-driven processes to help your company increase efficiency then good for you. But, if you've got someone on your team who can build full-stack autonomous processes equivalent to an organization and that can scale with every customer, then lucky you because they can take your company to the next realm.`,

      content: `Sunday night, 11:32 PM: Staring at a blank social media editor while launching My Calendy, I realized the irony... I built a productivity tool based on cognitive science that helps people work at their optimal times, yet here I was, creating marketing content when my brain was least equipped for creative work! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My first post on My Calendy feels like it was written by someone desperately trying to fit "all the science and passion" into one post. Sorry for the wall of text! This is what happens when you try to do marketing after hours.

This experience made me realize: If I struggle with this as someone devoted to productivity optimization, others must too. So I'm excited to announce an upcoming feature for My Calendy: AI-powered marketing campaign creation. We're building a tool that will:
- Create platform-specific campaigns from your uploaded content
- Schedule posts during optimal engagement windows
- Dynamically adjust future content based on post performance
- Build a narrative across multiple posts that tells your story effectively

The best part? This marketing feature will deliver the output of an entire marketing department at a fraction of the cost. What will make it truly powerful will be the adaptive learning. The system track will real engagement metrics from each post, then refine future content strategy based on what's actually working - continuously improving your results without requiring constant supervision.

In the meantime, check out My Calendy and see how matching your tasks to your cognitive peaks can transform your productivity: https://MyCalendy.fun

Who else struggles with creating social media content when you should be focusing on other priorities?

      content: `We're excited to announce the launch of My Calendy ‚Äì a productivity tool that combines cognitive science with advanced project management. Most scheduling tools only tell you WHEN to work. My Calendy tells you WHAT to work on WHEN, based on your brain's natural cognitive patterns.

For example, did you know most people have peak analytical ability in the morning, while creative work often flows better in the afternoon? My Calendy analyzes your unique cognitive timeline, current schedule, and project requirements to create the perfect task alignment, helping you:
‚Ä¢ Reduce decision fatigue
‚Ä¢ Match tasks to your cognitive strengths
‚Ä¢ Maximize productivity during peak hours
‚Ä¢ Create a more balanced workflow

We've just launched our 7-day free trial at https://MyCalendy.fun

We'd love to hear your thoughts on how cognitive science can improve your productivity!

        "Did you know that performing tasks at the wrong time of day can reduce your performance by up to 26%?",
      content: `Did you know that performing tasks at the wrong time of day can reduce your performance by up to 26%? Research shows that when tasks are not aligned with your chronotype (whether you're a morning lark or night owl), your basic cognitive abilities - from working memory to analytical processing - suffer significantly.

No matter how hard I worked in a day or how much I got done, I often felt like I could have accomplished more. Some days, despite making what seemed like progress, I barely felt like I'd taken a step forward. This frustration led me down a path of researching scheduling methods and productivity optimization.

What I discovered was fascinating: our cognitive abilities fluctuate dramatically throughout the day, and these patterns are largely predictable based on our chronotype. Morning people excel at analytical tasks early in the day, while night owls might perform complex creative work better in the evening.

The science was compelling, but more importantly, it was actionable. So, I started building https://MyCalendy.fun as a personal side project. What began as a tool to help me take back control of my schedule has grown into something I'm excited to share with you.

I realized I wasn't capturing my full mental potential by simply scheduling tasks in the next available slot, when it felt convenient, or when others chose my appointments for me. My Calendy works with you to understand your cognitive fluctuations and your schedule, then aligns your tasks accordingly.

Need analytical thinking? My Calendy schedules that for when your brain is sharpest. Creative writing? It plans that for when your imagination peaks. It's like having a personal productivity coach guiding you toward optimal performance hour by hour.

The results can be transformative. By matching your cognitive strengths to appropriate tasks throughout the day, you can reclaim hours of productive time each week. Whether you're a morning lark or a night owl, My Calendy ensures you're working at your cognitive best.

I built this tool because I wanted to work smarter, not harder. Now I'm inviting you to experience the difference that cognitive-based scheduling can make in your productivity and wellbeing.

You can read how the Crypto Policy Center approaches wallet regulation in the article below, though more research and concepts will be continually added.

From cryptography standards, to customer service, to insurance - all aspects of creating, owning, accessing, and securing a crypto wallet need to be considered. The goal of crypto wallet regulation should be to protect us consumers, identify and penalize the bad actors, all while supporting and encouraging #blockchain innovation.
